## üë§ Create_Users (.csv)
A script that automates Active Directory user creation from a spreadsheet of names/offices. Creates a parent OU with the name `New Employees`, groups for each office, and then creates and adds each user to their respective group.

Usernames are set to the initial of the first name followed by the surname. Each password is set to `!password1`.

For example, the name "John Smith" creates an account with the credentials:
- **Name**: John Smith
- **Username**: jsmith
- **Password**: !password1
